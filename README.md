# GridSolver
Hello, this is a simple program that I created after a friend of mine asked me how to do it. The program takes in 
a 2 dimensional grid. The computer prompts the user to ask where they would like to start on that two dimmensional 
grid then it asks the user where they would like to go and in how many moves they would like to get there. The 
programm then creates all of the possible solutions and ways that the user could get from the starting point to the
ending point.
